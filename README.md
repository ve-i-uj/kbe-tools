## License

I am not the author of this tool. The [original](https://github.com/jiangjiali/entity_tool "entity_tool") utility has the chinese localization. The project with the english localization was posted by the author in one of the [discussion](https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine/discussions/1408) branches of the [KBEngine](https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine "An open source MMOG server engine"). There is no English localization of the project directly in the author's repository, so there is no possibility to fork either. There are no licenses in the project too. I posted this project with links to the author.

I distributed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE.txt` for more information.
